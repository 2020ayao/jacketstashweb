        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</li>
      <p>
        <b>Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</b>
        We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers,
        contractors, or agents ("third parties") who perform services for us or
        on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We
        have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to
        help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do
        anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them
        to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any
        organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they
        hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. The
        third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Cloud Computing Services</b></li>
        <p>Firebase</p>
        <li><b>Web and Mobile Analytics</b></li>
        <p>FirebaseAnalytics</p>
        <li><b>Business Transfers</b></li>
        <p>
          We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or
          during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing,
          or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <li>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</li>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>

      <li>HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</li>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
        a secure environment.
      </p>
      <li>DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</li>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version
        will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version
        will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material
        changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently
        posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a
        notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently
        to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
